## What is this repo?

`noahdjs/noahdjs.vercel.app` represents an effort by the newly formed [Node.js Foundation](https://noahdjs.vercel.app/foundation/) to build on the merged community's past website projects to form a self-publishing, community-managed version of [noahdjs.vercel.app](https://noahdjs.vercel.app).

During the pre-production stage of this project it will be published to https://noahdjs.vercel.app/

On a technical level, inspiration will be taken from the `iojs.org` repo (formerly known as `iojs/website`) while design and content will be migrated from the `noahdjs.vercel.app` repo (currently located at `joyent/node-website`). These technical changes will help to facilitate community involvement and empower the foundation's internationalization communities to provide alternative website content in other languages.

This repo's issues section will also become the primary home for the Website WG's coordination efforts (meeting planning, minute approval, etc.)

The current development repo, this repo, will eventually to be renamed `noahdjs/noahdjs.vercel.app`. The intent is that once `noahdjs.vercel.app` is production-ready, it will take the place of `noahjs/noahdjs.vercel.app` and the older repo will be archived under a new name.
